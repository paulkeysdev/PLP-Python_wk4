## Assignment on File Handling 
# File Read and Write Program üñãÔ∏èüß™

This Python program demonstrates how to handle basic file operations: reading content from a file, modifying it, and saving the changes to a new file. It also includes error handling to manage cases where a file doesn't exist or isn't accessible.

---

## Features

1. **Read from a File**: Reads content from an input text file (`input.txt`).
2. **Modify Content**: Appends custom content to the original data.
3. **Write to a File**: Saves the modified data to a new file (`output.txt`).
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing files and permission issues.

---

## How to Use

1. Place your `input.txt` file in the same directory as this program.
2. Run the program using Python:
   ```bash
   python modify_text.py 
   python error_handling.py
